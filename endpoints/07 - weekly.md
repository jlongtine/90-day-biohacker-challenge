## Weekly Monitoring
- Psychometric Tests — [Cambridge Brain Sciences](http://www.cambridgebrainsciences.com/) 3 times/week, once at 12 pm (roughly 1 hour after taking nootropic regimen — esp SPRINT), and once at 10 pm.
- EEG monitoring at the same time (quantification of cognitive resources: attention, mental effort, familiarity) using [Emotiv Insight](https://www.emotiv.com/insight/)
